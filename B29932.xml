            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Considerations concerning the Prejudice which the Scotch Act Establishing a <hi>COMPANY</hi> to Trade to the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> (with large Priviledges, and on easie Terms) may bring to the English Sugar Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the Manufactury of Refining Sugar in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and some means to prevent the same from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and other Nations.</head>
            <p>THE present Parliament, both Lords and Commons, having been pleased to take into their Consideration, as matter of great moment, the Business of Trade in general, and particularly what Inconveniencies and Mischiefs the late Scotch Act may bring to the English <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West East-India</hi> Trade; no doubt, the Persons concerned in the several parts of those Trades, will severally lay open the Damage which <hi>England</hi> will suffer, by the Scotch and any other Nations Trading to those Parts, (or in the Commodities produced there) on easier and more advantagious Terms than this Kingdom doth; and amongst the rest the Trade of Sugar, which is become so large and beneficial to <hi>England,</hi> deserves not the least Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: For, whereas we were formerly supplyed with that Commodity from <hi>Portugal,</hi> which drew an Over-ballance of Money from hence; now, and of late we produce enough, not only to serve our own Consumption, but to export a great over-plus of raw or unpurged Sugar to <hi>Holland, Hambro,</hi> and before the War to <hi>France;</hi> and had gained a great Trade in Exporting our White <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the inequality of the Duty, and the advantages given to the Dutch and other Nations, to Refine our own raw Sugars, and to Export the Sugars which come White from the Plantations rendred it unprofitable, whereby the Manufacture here has been discouraged; and will be more so by the Scotch Act and Agents, if not prevented; for already the Scotch are seeking to bribe and intice away our Master-Workmen, and had actually hired one, to whom the Master was forced to advance his Wages 10 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to keep him.</p>
            <p>There needs no Argument to evince the great benefit which the Trade of Sugar has been to this Kingdom; not only by the Riches it has brought in, and the Employment of many Ships and Seamen, but by a Manufacture it has Establish't here at Home, which employs Thousands of People, who are Fed and Cloathed by our own Product, and before used to come from abroad: and which, if due Encouragement were given, would be Exported in great Quantities, to the further Enriching this Nation, and producing many other Advantages.</p>
            <p>It is agreed on all hands, That it is an advantage to any Nation to abound with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, especially such as are Laborious and Industrious, they help to consume our own Product, their Labour produces what turns into Money at home or abroad; and the more populous any Nation is, the stronger and better able it is to defend it self against any Foreign Power.</p>
            <p>It is also agreed, that the means to promote and encrease any Manufacture in <hi>England,</hi> is to render those employed therein as easy as may be; and especially to take care, if possible, that other Nations have not any Advantage of us; and this has continually been the care of the Crown and the Parliament, as any new Manufacture has been set up here. We have gained upon other Nations in the Manufacture of Silk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Product of other Countries; What then should hinder us from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing all others in the Manufacture of our Sugar which is our own Product, and wherein we have in our Power the advantage of all other People? the only reason
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:199302:2"/>I think, which can be assigned is, that as yet this matter has not met with the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable occasion to be duely Considered in Parliament; for want whereof, other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have beaten us out of the Trade of Exporting our Refin'd Sugar; and if the Scotch settle in any Plantation, and produce Sugar, it may become past Remedy, or by a quicker Method by enticing away our Workmen, they will at once Disable us from carrying it on. It is therefore to be seen how the Case stands.</p>

            <p>On Exportation of these Sugars half the Duty is paid back.</p>
            <p>On Exportation of White Sugar made in <hi>England,</hi> a Duty is paid for 100 Weight 6 <hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereby it appears, that other Nations have our raw or unpurged Sugar 9 <hi>d. per</hi> 100 weight cheaper than the English Refiners, which in 100 weight of White Sugar makes 2 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> 100 weight difference; and the White Sugar from the Plantations, paying Inwards 5<hi>s. per</hi> 100 weight, and drawing back half on Exportation, pays but 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d per</hi> 100 weight; whereas, if our Refiners Export White Sugar, it stands them in 5 <hi>s. per</hi> 100 weight Duty; <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. per</hi> 100 weight on the raw Sugar Imported, whereof 300 going to make 100 weight of White makes 4<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> and 6<hi>d. per</hi> 100 weight paid on Exportation, makes 5<hi>s. per</hi> 100 weight: So that on all hands, the English Refiner is under great disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and discouragement, which is further considerably increased by the high Duty of about 18 <hi>l. per</hi> Ton on Spirits drawn from English made Melasses. And hence it comes to pass, that Foreigners work up our raw Sugars, and furnish with White Loaf Sugar, those Markets which <hi>England</hi> might, and would highly be our advantage to supply. And it is in some degree as if we should send our Wool abroad to be Manufactured, and thence to be dispersed to Foreign Markers: For it is plain in fact, that now none of our White Loaf Sugar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> difficulties which the Refining Trade in <hi>England</hi> labours under, for the removing which in some measure it is humbly proposed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That (in Case the high Duty on Spirits drawn from English Melasses be continued) a Duty of 4 or 5<hi>s. per</hi> 100 weight may be laid upon all Melasses Imported from the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be Repaid on Exportation; which will not hurt the Plantations, it being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Planters that no Melasses were Exported from thence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. per</hi> 100 weight may be drawn back upon White Sugar made in <hi>England,</hi> as is upon White Sugar Imported from the Plantations, whereby the Crown will receive no prejudice; for that the more English Refined Sugar is Exported, the greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of White Sugar from the Plantations will be Expended in <hi>England,</hi> on which the King has the Duty of 5 <hi>s. per</hi> 100 weight.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That nothing be drawn back on Exportation of raw or unpurged Sugar, which will give some small encouragement of working it up here.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That whereas Sugars wrought and clayed in the Plantations, (called Purged Sugars) which are under the degree of Whites, pay only 1<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. per</hi> 100 weight as raw unpurged Sugars; the said Sugars may pay 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> 100 only more, which will then make an indifferent equality; and then the Duties will be thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On White Sugars — 5 <hi>s. per</hi> C. weight.</p>
            <p>On Clay'd Sugars under the degree of White 3 <hi>s. per</hi> C. weight.</p>
            <p>On Raw or <hi>Muscovado</hi> Sugars — 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> C. weight.</p>
            <p>This will encourage the Refining in <hi>England,</hi> and encrease the King's Revenue in all probability near 10000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and without prejudice to any but the Scotch and Foreigners.</p>
